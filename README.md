# Book Library Management System

## Description:
This project is a simple Book Library Management System implemented in PHP. It provides basic functionality to manage a collection of books, including adding, updating, and deleting book entries. The user interface is a web-based application with HTML forms for inserting, updating, and deleting books. The book details are stored in a database, and the application interacts with the database using a PHP class named `DB`.

## Features:
1. **Insert Book:**
   - Users can add a new book to the library by providing the title, author, and published year through the "Add Book" form.

2. **Display Books:**
   - The system displays the existing books in a table format, showing the book's ID, title, author, published year, and a "Delete" button for each entry.

3. **Update Book:**
   - Users can edit the details of an existing book using the "Edit Book" form. The form allows users to select a book from the existing entries and update its title, author, and published year.

4. **Delete Book:**
   - Books can be deleted from the library by clicking the "Delete" button associated with each book entry in the table.
